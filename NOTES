1.  Array indexing:

       a(i,j) -- i = column index
		 j = row index

2.  READF to assign an array reads consecutively,
    and assigns consecutively, filling in rows first.
    ("Row major", is the jargon, I think.)

3.  Variables we are interested in (see hyades_shell.pro):

        time, rz, u, rho, pres, te, tion, tr, 
	zbar, lasi, rcm, ucm
