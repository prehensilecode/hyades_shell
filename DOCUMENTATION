                                    HYADES SHELL v.2
                                    ================
        
        
        A.  Introduction
            ------------
        
            The IDL .pro file, hyades_shell, is a main-level procedure for
            analyzing HYADES (1D) data.  Almost all functionality is accessible
            through the text-based menus.  The only thing that does not work
            properly through the menus is the animation.  To run the animation,
            the animation procedure has to be called manually.  After
            HYADES_SHELL quits, it leaves all data from the .OTF file in the
            common block HYAD_DATA.
        
        
        B.  Running HYADES_SHELL
            --------------------
        
            HYADES_SHELL reads data from the .OTF file that hyades produces.
        
            Working directory
            -----------------
            To run HYADES_SHELL, the current directory or working directory has
            to contain the datafile.  In UNIX, this can be accomplished by
            changing to the appropriate directory before starting IDL.  It can
            also be accomplished after IDL has been started by using the CD
            procedure to change directories (see IDL Help).  On the Macintosh,
            set the "Working Directory" by using "Apple(Command)-;", or the
            appropriate menu option.
        
        
            Running HYADES_SHELL
            --------------------
            1. In IDL, type
        
                     .run HYADES_SHELL
        
            2. HYADES_SHELL will prompt for a "runname".  The runname
               is the name of the .OTF file without the .OTF suffix,
               e.g. "denramp14.otf" has "denramp14" as its runname.
        
            3. HYADES_SHELL will then prompt for the "Number of
               Dumps".  This is the number of time steps for which
               data was written out.  Enter an integer for a number of
               dumps, or enter "0" (zero) for HYADES_SHELL to get all
               the dumps.
        
        
        C.  Main functions
            --------------
        
            The plots that can be produced by HYADES_SHELL are:
        
            1. Te, Tion, Rho, U, Pres vs. Zones (y-axis) & Time
               (x-axis).  The values of the variables plotted are
               represented by colors.
        
            2. Te, Tion, Rho, U, Pres vs. Rcm (y-axis) & Time
               (x-axis).  The values of the variables plotted are
               represented by colors.
        
            3. Rho, Ucm, Pres, Te, Tion, Tr vs. Rcm, at 5 different
               times.  These plots are all made in one window.  Each
               graph in the window consists of 6 plots (curves): 5
               plots evenly spaced in time, and the zero (or one,
               depending) time index plot.  The plots at different
               times are done with different colors.  There is a
               text-based menu for changing plot parameters.
        
            4. Animations of Rho, Ucm, Pres, Te, Tion, Tr vs. Rcm.  To
               do animations, one has to Quit from HYADES_SHELL.
               HYADANIM accesses the common block HYAD_DATA to get the
               data.
        
        
        D.   HYADANIM
             --------
        
             HYADANIM is called this way:
        
                 hyadanim, var,  $
                       xrange=xrange, yrange=yrange,  $
                       /plotrho, $
                       rhorange=rhorange,
                       /help, $
                       /bigwin
        
             All keywords are optional.
        
             Arguments:
        
                      var      A string containing the name of the variable 
                               to be plotted.  Legal names are:
                                      rho
                                      pres
                                      ucm
                                      te
                                      tion
                                      tr
        
             Keywords:
        
                      xrange   A 2-element vector containing the range of Rcm
                               over which to plot. 
                               E.g. xrange=[-.02, .08]
        
                      yrange   A 2-element vector containing the range of the
                               variable over which to plot. 
                               E.g. yrange=[1.e-4, 0.1] 
        
                      /plotrho If set, HYADANIM will plot the density
                               Rho on the same graph in dashed lines.
        
                      rhorange A 2-element vector containing the range of 
                               Rho to be plotted.
        
                      /help    Prints out short help on calling HYADANIM, and
                               does nothing else.
        
                      /bigwin  Makes a large window for animating in.  Useful
                               for taking datapoints off each fram using the
                               CURSOR procedure.
        
              
              Example:
        
                      hyadanim, 'tion', xrange=[-.02, .08], /plotrho, /bigwin
        
        
                      This will put up an animation window, with the Rcm-axis 
                      (x-axis) range of [-.02, .08], overlay the tion plot with
                      a plot of rho, in a big window.
        
        
              Caution:
        
                      The animation takes up a lot of memory.  Currently, it
                      runs without problems only on Remnant (or any Unix
                      machine), and the G3 PowerMac with 256MB of RAM.
