1.  Hmm.  Printing out transpose(tr(1,0:6)) after hyades_shell ends
    and comparing it with the .otf file shows me that the numbers
    only agree to 3 significant figures, or sometimes 2 sig fig.
    Figure out why!

2.  Since we don't use either zone numbers or region numbers, no sense
    storing them in "array" in read_hyades.pro.  Fix that.

        -- Done

3.  rcm is one of the outputs in the OTF file.  Do we need
    to compute it?

        -- Yes.  Done.
